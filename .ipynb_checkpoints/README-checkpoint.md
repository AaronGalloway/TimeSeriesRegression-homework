3. ARMA Model
4. ARIMA Model
5. GARCH Model

## Time Series Analysis Conclusion
Would you buy the Yen now?
- Volatility is projected to go up up in the next few days, and with more volatility comes more opportunity for profits. I would buy.

Is the risk expected to go up or down?
- Risk is projected to go up, but the highest the risk the higher the opportunity for reward

Would you trust these models?
- The AIC and BIC numbers seem really high. Therefore I would be wary of trusting these models.

## Linear Regression Conclusion
The In-Sample performance has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (0.459) than the Out-Of-Sample performance (0.571). Therefore the model does better with data it has seen before and is not all that strong for predicting unknown data.
